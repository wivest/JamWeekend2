The game was created within 6 hours. Code is written by myself, assets and font are from the Internet.

## Gameplay

Shoot to give yourself an impulse, the less bullets you have, the farther you travel. You have 3 bullets at start and each ammunition gives you 3 more. Score is evaluated by amount of ammo you have collected. Highest score is saved between sessions. If you run out of bullets or fall down the game is restarted.
